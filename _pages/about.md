I am a doctoral student in Statistics at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/) under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/). 

I am interested in the study and design of new statistical models and computational methods that can be used to solve open questions in applied fields. In particular, my research focuses on the use of Bayesian methods in social sciences. I also follow developments in other fields, such as machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.

Feel free to reach me for any question!
