I am a doctoral student in Statistics at Bocconi University under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/). 

I am interested in the study and design of new statistical models and methods that can be used to solve open questions in applied fields. In particular, I am fascinated by the use of Bayesian methods in the field of social sciences and the impact they have in the society. 

My research is focused on Bayesian modelling, social sciences, and computational statistics.

I am also interested to investigate new directions, specially in topics such as machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.

Feel free to reach me for any question!
