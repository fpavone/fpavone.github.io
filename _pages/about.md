I am a doctoral student in Statistics at Bocconi University under the supervision of [Daniele Durante](https://danieledurante.github.io/web/). I am strongly interested in the study and design of new statistical models and methods that can be used to solve open questions in applied fields. In particular, I am fascinated by the use of Bayesian methods in the field of social sciences and the impact they have in the society.
